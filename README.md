# ToDo List App

This project is a React application designed to manage and track tasks that need to be completed. It provides the ability to create, view, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.

## Features

-   Login and Registration Page: The application includes a login and registration page where users can create an account or log in to an existing account to access the task management functionality.
-   API Integration: All task management operations, such as creation, viewing, editing, and deletion, are performed through an API. Interacting with the server allows for saving task data on the server and exchanging information between the client-side and server-side of the application.
